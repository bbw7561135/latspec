	Fermi LAT Xspec Analysis  (version 0.1.1)

The Latspec is a graphical interactive analysis tool designed for
reduction and analysis of the Fermi/LAT (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc) 
data using Xspec astrophysical spectral fitting package 
(http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xanadu/xspec). The tool
is integrated with Fermi Science Tools, FTOOLS, Xspec and 
DS9 imaging tool (hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9) to provide
fast and convenient analysis steps from LAT server data to spectral modeling.


To install:

   # verify that you have installed ds9 and that the Fermi
   # Science tools, FTOOLS and Xspec are properly installed and set up

   # unpack the source tar file and change to the source directory
   > tar zxvf latspec-0.1.1.tar.gz
   > cd latspec-0.1.1

   # install in the default python directory in the Fermi Science
   # tools directory
   > python setup.py install

To run:
   
   > latspec

program window.

Note: Latspec lightcurve extraction relies on the cpflux Xspec model
to estimate fluxes. To make sure lightcurve part of the program is 
working properly, please, install Xspec version 12.8.1 or later
before using Latspec.
